  #### Problem 1:  
  Consider inserting the keys 71, 23, 73, 99, 44, 79, 89 into a hash table of size N = 10.  
  Show the result of hashing using:  
  * separate chaining 
  * open addressing with linear probing
  
  #### Problem 2:
  Design a data structure that can perform the given operations in the stated worst-case running time:  

	Insert: O(lg n)  
	Maximum: O(1)  
	Minimum: O(1)  
	Extract-max: O(lg n)  
	Extract-min: O(lg n) 
	
   #### Problem 3:
   Writ
